### Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from the official website. If you're using a Linux-based system, you might need to install Python separately. Additionally, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment for Python projects to avoid conflicts between dependencies. You can use tools like venv for this. Lastly, you'll need Git installed to clone the project repository. Git can be downloaded from its official website.
