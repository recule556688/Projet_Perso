## 📌 About

Welcome to my repository of personal projects, developed during my tenure in France at [Epitech](https://www.epitech.eu/), Lyon. This collection demonstrates my software development skills and interests.

## ✨ Projects

### 📁 [GlobalSort](https://github.com/recule556688/Global_Sort)

GlobalSort is my first foray into Python development. It's a robust file organization tool that I created to learn Python and find an efficient solution for file organization. This project is a testament to my ability to create practical solutions and my passion for learning new technologies.

### 📁 [GlobalSort GUI](https://github.com/recule556688/GlobalSort_GUI)

GlobalSort GUI is an evolution of the original GlobalSort project, introducing a user-friendly graphical interface for file organization. Built with Python, this tool allows users to sort and manage files easily, with support for various file types, custom folders, and extensions. The GUI version also features automatic updates, ensuring you always have the latest enhancements at your fingertips.

#### Features

- Sort music, video, image, document, and download files.
- Customize folders and extensions for sorting.
- Undo last operation.
- Modern and user-friendly GUI with automatic updates.

### 🎥 [YoutubeDownloader](https://github.com/recule556688/Youtube_Downloader)

YoutubeDownloader is a user-friendly YouTube video downloader. Built with Python, it leverages the [Pytube](https://pypi.org/project/pytube/) library and [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for the GUI. It allows users to download and save videos from YouTube, providing video information such as the author, publish date, views, thumbnail, and duration. This project showcases my skills in creating intuitive GUIs and working with APIs.

### 🖼️ [Portfolio](https://github.com/recule556688/portfolio)

The Portfolio project is a showcase of my skills, work experience, and accomplishments. Built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, this project emphasizes my front-end development capabilities. It serves as a personal website where you can find detailed information about my professional background, completed projects, and ways to contact me. This project highlights my ability to create responsive, visually appealing websites that effectively communicate my personal and professional brand.

#### Features of the Portfolio project include

- Responsive design that works great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Smooth scrolling and animations for an engaging user experience.
- Sections for showcasing projects, skills, and contact information.
- Built with modern web technologies for optimal performance.
